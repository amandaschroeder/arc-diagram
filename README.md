TODOs
- add css ids to complete and exit
- move exit to bottom left under viz
- make it vertical
- add logic to check for forward/reverse movement in edgelist.csv data (rather than hardcoding it) - or consider making this a step in the data pull
- style arc paths differently for forward/reverse movement

- include # of exits - as total first, but later as total from each individual step
- add hover info (forward/reverse, amount)
